# Proto source files (optional, but good to ignore if generated from outside)
# backend/proto/
# You might want to include proto files in version control if they are the source of truth,
# but if they are treated as entirely generated or managed by `run.sh` then ignoring them is fine.
# For this "Hello World" setup, where run.sh creates it, ignoring it is reasonable.
